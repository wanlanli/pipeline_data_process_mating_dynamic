    """
    Tracks cells across different frames in a time-lapse movie (image) to assign unique IDs to each cell over time.
    The image is expected to be a 4D numpy array representing a sequence of frames over time, each containing multiple
    channels of data, including one for segmentation results. This function uses the segmentation channel to track cells
    across the frames, appending the tracking results as an additional channel to the output image.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        A 4D numpy array with shape (Time, Channel, Width, Height), representing a time-lapse movie where each frame
        contains multiple channels of data, including at least one segmentation channel.

    channel : int, optional
        The index (0-based) of the channel within `image` that contains the segmentation results. Defaults to 3,
        indicating that the fourth channel is the segmentation channel.

    is_save_tracker : bool
        If True, the function returns both the tracked image array and the tracker object. If False, only the tracked
        image array is returned.

    *args, **kwargs :
        Additional arguments and keyword arguments for future use or for passing optional parameters to underlying
        methods or functions involved in the tracking process.

    Returns:
    ---------
    If `is_save_tracker` is False:
        tracked : np.ndarray
            A 4D numpy array with shape (Time, Channel + 1, Width, Height), with tracking results appended as an
            additional channel. Each cell tracked over time is assigned a unique ID.
    If `is_save_tracker` is True:
        (tracked, tracer) : Tuple[np.ndarray, object]
            - tracked: As described above.
            - tracer: The tracker object, which includes the tracking network and relationships like cell division
              and fusion.

    Note:
    -----
    The implementation of this function depends on cellmating.sort.Tracker for cell tracking based on segmentation results.
    The exact method are not described here.
